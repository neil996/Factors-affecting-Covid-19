Analyzing differing factors and age groups contributing to COVID-19 deaths across distinct counties in U.S.A
The project aims to generalize the effects of Novel coronavirus across different counties in United States Of America and moreover discuss various different factors affecting the same. We have taken into account multiple age factors which are getting affected due to the virus and moreover takes into account different condition factors.
The project looks to find distinct and diverse factors in various age groups, i.e. how they are impacting Covid deaths and cases across various regions in United States. The domain of the datasets is related to health care as discussed above the project aims to identify the impact of Covid. The datasets have been selected to take into account all these factors so as to combine diverse factors to get a generalized sense from the available data. The data is obtained mainly from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention which is Federal organization collecting data on daily or random basis as per their availability, moreover as per their description states and local authorities reports the cases regularly to keep the data up to date.


The project is related to healthcare domain and target the nature and cause of pandemic which has caused ravaged around the world. As of October of 2020 various adults aged between different age groups that re between 20 to 35 and ages 35 to 49 are the ones whose transmission rates have been more than one and this phenomenon is found consistently among such adults with varying age groups. as more and more age groups in Elder people the virus is showing a strong grip hold and thus states should aware in these section of age groups to take consistent precaution as the virus effects are endangering to mass population moreover taking into account the rate of infection rate to which the virus spreads, the project is motivated by the sheer amount of death rates and increasing number of cases as each day passes. Moreover as the study suggests that the age groups from 20 to 49 are seeing an increase in transmission rates daily, thus figure shows 72.2 percent of Covid-19 carriers are peoples in these age groups.
The project takes an distinctive approach to find out the patterns in Covid patients, as the project takes into account datasets from different domains such as the first dataset takes into account the newly positive covid-19 cases while the second dataset is used to get patterns among various probable, confirmed and new cases and deaths and lastly we take into account different age groups and along with diverse condition groups such as Respiratory Diseases, Circulatory Disease, Diabetes, Obesity and many others have a contribution in covid-19 deaths across different counties across the country.
